# Jobify

## Demo

[Demo App Here](https://mern-course-jobify-knmu.onrender.com)

## Inspiration

This project was created by following John Smilga's "MERN Stack Course 2023 - MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS" course on Udemy. I would highly recommend this course for anyone wanting to touch up their MERN skills or learn React hooks in a practical way.
